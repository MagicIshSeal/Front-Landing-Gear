# Front Landing Gear
this is the code to deploy the front landing gear of the year 2 project plane made by students of InHolland.

# Features
The code was made in VsCode using PlatformIO, so the repo is structures to accompany that. If you just want the raw file, go into ```src/main.cpp``` thats where the main file is. Files for Wokwi are also included so that simulation is possible either online or in VsCode.
